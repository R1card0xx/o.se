# o.se
o.se is an app being developed for university students who want more control over their academic and financial lives, but without a legacy interface or having to pay for/watch ads to use it. Its purpose is to manage and highlight how much a student spends or can save throughout their studies. Its name, O.Se, derives from its full name in Portuguese: Organize-se (Get Organized), inspired solely by a crazy idea that popped into my head during my morning commute to the university cafeteria while I was thinking about how to pay my bills... okay, let's get back to the app.

## Purpose
Its proposal is quite simple, and since it has two purposes, academic and financial, I will explain them in two parts:

The financial part is this:

to register, compare, identify patterns and alert the user, whether for promotions or to warn that they cannot buy a slice of cake, otherwise they will exceed their credit card limit...

Register:
It allows the user to capture the invoice (or sales receipt) to record daily purchases, describe which products are essential for survival or if they were simply driven by desire.

Compare:
Through the records, it will be possible to compare which products have changed from one day to the next, which supermarkets have a certain product cheaper - comparing even with products on the internet -, what is the best day to buy, both for card use and in supermarkets. In addition, through the "Scan product" function, the user can check if the product in the supermarket is worth it or if it is more worthwhile to walk a little further to buy that product. Identifying Patterns:
This is part of the comparison feature, but it includes, in an "algorithmized" way, the intuition of when supermarket promotions will be, which time of year is best for traveling, for holding an event...

This step is very focused on supermarkets, but it can also be used for other things, such as transportation, leisure, health...

For the academic part:
It brings with it the same resources as the financial one, but focused solely on studies: academic calendar, exam grades (and what grade is needed to pass the subject), which symposiums and events are available.

## Development
This project is being developed during my free time, so the final version may take a while. If you wish, feel free to cooperate with the project.
